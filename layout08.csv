"* BGN_RANGE, BGN_AZI, and BGN_LOCATI work together to fix the starting point of an event. For instance, if the three fields read “2.00,” “S” and “Lake Charles,” then that means the event began 2 miles south of Lake Charles. These figures will not be available for large-scale events, such as floods and winter storms, where the event covers a large area and doesn't have a specific beginning point.",,,,
